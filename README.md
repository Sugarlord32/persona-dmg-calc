# THIS BRANCH CONTAINS UNTESTED CODE BASED ON THE ORIGINAL, ALL "CLEANED UP" BY CLAUDE AI. THIS BRANCH WILL BE UNSUPPORTED AND UNTESTED AS IT WAS JUST MADE FOR FUNSIES

calc is slang for calculator if you didnt know

i don't know if half of this shit works lol crashes might be here

made by a combination of me and AI help since idk how to code too well

"reset" command doesn't work

got the calculations from the smt wiki but the results were very small so I multiply the final damage by 20, writing "multi" in the "main menu" lets you change that multiplier to your taste (although some calculations might've been accidentally changed in the code while this was in development i didn't check)

most of the values asked for can be found in the smt wiki

jank code don't look at it
