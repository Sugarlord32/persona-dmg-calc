# persona-dmg-calc
calc is slang for calculator if you didnt know

i don't know if half of this shit works lol crashes might be here

made by a combination of me and AI help since idk how to code too well

"reset" command doesn't work

got the calculations from the smt wiki but the results were very small so I multiply the final damage by 20, writing "multi" in the "main menu" lets you change that multiplier to your taste

most of the values asked for can be found in the smt wiki
